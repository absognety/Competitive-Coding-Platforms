-- A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.

-- Write a solution to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.

-- Return the result table in any order.

-- The result format is in the following example.

-- Example 1:

-- Input: 
-- Employee table:
-- +----+-------+--------+--------------+
-- | id | name  | salary | departmentId |
-- +----+-------+--------+--------------+
-- | 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
-- | 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
-- | 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
-- | 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
-- | 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
-- | 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
-- | 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |
-- +----+-------+--------+--------------+
-- Department table:
-- +----+-------+
-- | id | name  |
-- +----+-------+
-- | 1  | IT    |
-- | 2  | Sales |
-- +----+-------+
-- Output: 
-- +------------+----------+--------+
-- | Department | Employee | Salary |
-- +------------+----------+--------+
-- | IT         | Max      | 90000  |
-- | IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
-- | IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
-- | IT         | Will     | 70000  |
-- | Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
-- | Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
-- +------------+----------+--------+
-- Explanation: 
-- In the IT department:
-- - Max earns the highest unique salary
-- - Both Randy and Joe earn the second-highest unique salary
-- - Will earns the third-highest unique salary

-- In the Sales department:
-- - Henry earns the highest salary
-- - Sam earns the second-highest salary
-- - There is no third-highest salary as there are only two employees

-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below
-- Solution
with rank_salaries_each_dep as (
    select employee.id as emp_id,
           employee.name as emp_name,
           department.id as dep_id,
           department.name as dep_name,
           employee.salary as employee_salary,
           dense_rank() over (partition by department.id,department.name 
           order by employee.salary desc) rank
    from department inner join employee 
    on department.id = employee.departmentId
)
select dep_name as Department,
       emp_name as Employee,
       employee_salary as Salary
from rank_salaries_each_dep where rank in (1,2,3);
