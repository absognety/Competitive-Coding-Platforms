Programming questions from different competitive coding platforms for Algorithms and Data Structures  
===========================================  
  
#### About this Repository:
+ I have been developing this repository for some time, I have been upgrading this repo with latest coding solutions and questions that I have been encountering in different tests, practice and also my own personal collection (Hackerearth + GeeksForGeeks)  
  
+ The Coding questions from other platforms like hackerrank, interviewBit, Daily Coding Problem, Skillenza, Interviewing.io are also included here - directories are created separately for different data structures.The idea is to capture maximum number of problem models in this repository.  
  
+ The questions for few problems are shared in the form of images (JPEGs/PNGs) and for few problems they are embedded in code itself in the form of multiline docstrings.  

+ Daily Coding problem & Interviewing.io solutions are the recent addition.  

+ For most of the questions along with optimal solutions, my non-optimal versions are also included, so feel free to improve this repo by contributing to it with your own stable and optimal codes by creating a pull request üòõ üëç.
