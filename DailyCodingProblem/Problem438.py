Daily Coding Problem #438

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Implement a stack API using only a heap. A stack implements the 
following methods:

push(item), which adds an element to the stack
pop(), which removes and returns the most recently added element 
(or throws an error if there is nothing on the stack)
Recall that a heap has the following operations:

push(item), which adds a new key to the heap
pop(), which removes and returns the max value of the heap

Solution:
    Duplicate of daily coding problem #154 - `implementStackWithHeap.py`
