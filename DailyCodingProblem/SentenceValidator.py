Daily Coding Problem #431

This problem was asked by Nest.

Create a basic sentence checker that takes in a stream of characters 
and determines whether they form valid sentences. If a sentence is 
valid, the program should print it out.

We can consider a sentence valid if it conforms to the following rules:

The sentence must start with a capital letter, followed by a lowercase 
letter or a space.
All other characters must be lowercase letters, separators (,,;,:) or 
terminal marks (.,?,!,â€½).
There must be a single space between each word.
The sentence must end with a terminal mark immediately following 
a word.

        assert sentence == sentence.capitalize(), "Rest of characters except first letter are not lowercase"

        if "" in words:
            raise AssertionError("Single space between words condition failed")
